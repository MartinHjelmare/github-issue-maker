Add improved scene support for the {{ DOMAIN }} integration by implementing [reproduce state support](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/reproduce_state_index.html).

To get started with this issue, you will need to set up a Home Assistant development environment. The easiest approach is to get started using [a dev container](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/development_environment.html#developing-with-devcontainer).

Once you have a development environment set up, run the following and follow the instructions:

```python
python3 -m script.scaffold reproduce_state
```
