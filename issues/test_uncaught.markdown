We have just merged #33312 which makes sure that a test fails if it has uncaught exceptions while it was running. This was not considered a failure before.

We had to ignore several existing tests that had uncaught exceptions. This included some tests of the {{ DOMAIN }} integration. These tests will need to be fixed.

The ignored tests can be found [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/tests/ignore_uncaught_exceptions.py). To fix this, remove the lines for your integration from that file, run your test suite and make sure all tests pass.
